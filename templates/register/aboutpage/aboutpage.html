    <p>
        A recent survey on career option awareness among indian students has revealed that a staggering 93% of the students aged 14 to 21 were aware of just seven career options ythough there are more than 250 different types of job options available in India.
        The main reason behind the problem is that there are a huge number of youth passing out from schools and colleges
        every year, and there are many new career options and job roles being added to various industries in well.
        Students feel much more confident in choosing a particular career when they are supported by their parents.
